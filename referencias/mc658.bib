abstract = {We present the talent scheduling problem and provide several hybrid genetic search algorithms for solving this problem. The problem is of scheduling the independent activities of a project (such as a movie) so that the cost of keeping talents (actors) on the project site when not needed is minimized. The problem is an NP-hard problem. The proposed hybrid algorithms use limited pairwise interchange heuristic procedure within the simple genetic algorithm framework. We report very impressive results on a set of problems with known optimal solutions. ?? 1994.},

@article{Qin2016,
abstract = {The talent scheduling problem is a simplified version of the real-world film shooting problem, which aims to determine a shooting sequence so as to minimize the total cost of the actors involved. In this article, we first formulate the problem as an integer linear programming model. Next, we devise a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the problem. The branch-and-bound algorithm is enhanced by several accelerating techniques, including preprocessing, dominance rules and caching search states. Extensive experiments over two sets of benchmark instances suggest that our algorithm is superior to the current best exact algorithm. Finally, the impacts of different parameter settings, algorithm components and instance generation distributions are disclosed by some additional experiments.},

@article{Cheng1993,
abstract = {The problem of minimizing the cost due to talent hold days in the production of a feature film is considered. A combinatorial model is developed for the sequencing of shooting days in a film shoot. The problem is shown to be strongly NP-hard. A branch-and-bound solution algorithm and a heuristic solution method for large instances of the problem (15 shooting days or more) are developed and implemented on a computer. A number of randomly generated problem instances are solved to study the power and speed of the algorithms. The computational results reveal that the heuristic solution method is effective and efficient in obtaining near-optimal solutions. {\textcopyright} 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

@article{DeLaBanda2011,
abstract = {We give a dynamic programming solution to the problem of scheduling scenes to minimize the cost of the talent. Starting from a basic dynamic program, we show a number of ways to improve the dynamic programming solution by preprocessing and restricting the search. We show how by considering a bounded version of the problem, and determining lower and upper bounds, we can improve the search. We then show how ordering the scenes from both ends can drastically reduce the search space. The final dynamic programming solution is orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches and finds optimal solutions to larger problems than were considered previously.},
